            <li>4 teaspoons Finely chopped shallot </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons White wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons Finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons Lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Whole grain mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Finely chopped chives</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped capers</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce, to taste</li>

        </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>1. In a small bowl, mix shallots, vinegar, and water. Allow the mixture to marinate for 5 minutes. Drain the shallots and discard the liquid, when ready.</li>
            <li>2. Fill a bowl 2/3 of the way with ice cubes. Place a second bowl on top of the first. This will keep the salmon cool during preparation. </li>
            <li>3. Dice the salmon into bite-sized pieces. Place the diced salmon into the chilled bowl.</li>
            <li>4. Add the shallot mix to the bowl containing the salmon. Add salt and pepper for seasoning, and mix contents in the bowl, thoroughly.</li>
            <li>5.  Serve immediately with bread, crackers, or salad. The salmon tartare can also be refrigerated, but it is recommended not to keep 
                refrigerated for more than one day.</li>
        </ol>
